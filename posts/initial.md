This blog has been a long time in my mind. I like to read, and I should also write about what I read. That enables me to absorb and grasp the things.

Well, what I want to write about? This could be about my sports life, or about my studies, but mostly what I feel I want to write about is stuff I read. 
It really inspires me, and this page should be about me learning stuff: (first of all, coding a website) getting ideas and being inspired about and trying to 
find a wording for all these things. This post is in English, but I feel that I should write according to the language I have read, so if book is in 
English, I will post in English and so on. 

So, this is a reading diary of a 23-year-old amateur athlete / computer science student, who loves relentlessly maps and descriptions about world we live in. 
Most of all, philosophy fascinates me and question that I get stuck so many times a day is quite involved in it: Why? Why things happen, why we should care,
why should we do things at all? Why some things matter to us but not to others? Can a machine think? Should we care if it thinks? Or should we care more about 
if we give it a role of moral agent? Some things I have read lately, and would like to maybe write a post about. 

And above all, I am writing this for me to help me understand the world a little better.
